# Video Game Sales Data Analysis and Visualization  

What if we would plan to develop and release a video game? (The one that would give us not only a pleasure to work on, but some profit too) We would need to decide on many things first. Analysis of Video Game Sales could help us with that.


The dashboard below will answer these questions:
1. What genres are more profitable?
2. Where to distribute the game?
3. Games with what ratings bring more sales?
4. What publisher to choose?

## 1. What genres are more profitable?
According to the chart in the bottom right corner the top 5 most profitable genres are: Action, Adventure, Fighting, Miscellaneous and Platform.

## 2. Where to distribute the game?
Comparing North America and European Union sales we can see that European Union started to buy more games than North America recently, but the difference isn't that big. So we could choose either way.

## 3. Games with what ratings bring more sales?
Top 3 Ratings by Sales are: E ("Everyone"), M ("Mature": 17+) and T ("Teenagers": 13+).

## 4. What publisher to choose?
Top 10 Publishers: Hello Games, Valve, Slightly Mad Studious, Sony, Trion Worlds, Harmonix Music Systems, Screenlife, Level 5, Activision Blizzard, Tetris Online.

Not filtered data showed companies in the top, that were selling a lot in the past, but now they aren't. So the publisher sales got filtered by year to get the relevant information.

## Bonus question. Which game genres have more releases?
The first question was about the profit of different genres, but the profit could be gained not only by selling more expensive items, but also by selling more items. To check if our top sellers sold more games we can count the games in each genre.

Now we can see that our top seller ("Action" genre) sold more games in total, so it could be one of the reasons it is on the top of our list. Other top selling genres did not get into the top 5 by the amount of sold games, so the other reasons were playing role in their sales.
