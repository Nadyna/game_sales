# Video Game Sales Data Analysis and Visualization  

What if we would plan to develop and release a video game? (The one that would give us not only a pleasure to work on, but some profit too) We would need to decide on many things first. Analysis of Video Game Sales could help us with that.


1. What genres are more profitable?
2. Where to distribute the game?
3. Games with what ratings bring more sales?
4. What publisher to choose?
